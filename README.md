# HexFolio

This is a self hosted stock portfolio viewing dashboard meant to run as a docker container. This program adds up your total holdings as listed in the holdings.yaml file and hosts them on a local site which graphs their movements live.

## Use
Put your holdings in holdings.yaml (As seen in the example, under tickers you put TICKER: SHARES). Configure Config.yaml to your liking, setting your theme, prefered port, movement alert threshholds, and more, then open the page on your device of choice. 

## Future Feature Ideas
- Button to add a ticker and quantity (ruamel.yaml looks good for this)
- Swappable themes
- NTFY integration for movement notifications (Daily recaps or price spike events)

## Dev Roadmap:
1. ~Proof of concept~
2. ~Functional TUI~
3. ~Build in FastAPI so it can display basically the TUI on a webserver~
4. Build out each page to display basic JSON outputs and have some functionality for changing settings
5. Get Plotly.js working to display live graphs of the data
6. Lots of polish
7. Dockerize the whole thing to work as a container
8. Expand on features, add customization, etc.

## Feature List

#### Version 0.2.2
- Plotly js graphs added!
- Expanded settings, improved app flow, hisorical data fixes
- A bunch of other small fixes

#### Version 0.2.1
- Each page is set up
- Ticker service is now active for use in a side project

#### Version 0.2.0
- Random scripts no more! It is now a *semi* fucntional app!
- Webhosting is now working (technically... Thats gonna be a huge focus for the next few weeks)
- I broke down the handful of scripts into two seperate apps 
- NTFY support groundwork has been laid (I will make that work later, but it's in the works)

#### Version 0.1.2
- Full project structure has been reworked
- Essentially 2 scripts, split up into modules that make sense and are far more scalable
- Framework has been laid to get FastApi up and running
- I will polish up what is here, add a few small features and refine my backend and then move onto the frontend work!

#### Version 0.1.1
- Much better TUI!
- Uses rich for table, color, and live data
- Reworked a lot of the code to be more cohesive

#### Version 0.1.0
- Proof of concept really
- Uses the given YAML portfolio and calculates the total and continuously prints it in the terminal
- Bare bones back end to build on essentially
